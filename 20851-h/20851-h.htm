neglect. So the duke deputed Angelo to enforce it, and, assuming the

proposed by Angelo were out of the question. The duke, disguised as a

This was done; but Angelo sent the provost to behead Claudio, a crime

money, and the Jew demanded the forfeiture. On the trial which ensued,
Portia, in the dress of a law doctor, conducted the case, and, when the

bond stated &#8220;a pound of flesh,&#8221; and that, therefore, he was to shed no

<p>Merlin died spell-bound, but the author and manner of his death are
given differently by different authorities. Thus, in the <i>History of

Nimue or Ninive inveigled the old man, and &#8220;covered him with a stone
under a rock.&#8221; In the <i>Morte d&#8217;Arthur</i> it is said &#8220;he sleeps and sighs
in an old tree, spell-bound by Vivien.&#8221; Tennyson, in his <i>Idylls</i>
(&#8220;Vivien&#8221;), says that Vivien induced Merlin to take shelter from a storm
in a hollow oak tree, and left him spell-bound. Others say he was
spell-bound in a hawthorn bush, but this is evidently a blunder. (See

promised to give his daughter, Hermia, in marriage to Dem&#275;trius; but, as

of her, followed by Hel&#277;na, who doted on him. All four came to a forest,
and fell asleep. In their dreams a vision of fairies passed before them,

and to take to wife Helena, who sincerely loved him. When Egeus was
informed thereof, he readily agreed to give his daughter to Lysander,
and the force of the law was not called into action (1592).</p>

in a rude age, from the first dawn of fancy to the fullness of poetic
rapture. The first canto is descriptive of Edwin, the minstrel; canto
ii. is dull philosophy, and there, happily, the poem ends. It is a pity
it did not end with the first canto (1773-4).</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="i1">And yet poor Edwin was no vulgar boy,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Deep thought oft seemed to fix his infant eye.</span><br />
<span class="i1">Dainties he heeded not, nor gaude, nor toy,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Save one short pipe of rudest minstrelsy;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Silent when sad, affectionate, tho&#8217; shy;</span><br />
<span class="i1">And now his look was most demurely sad;</span><br />
<span class="i2">And now he laughed aloud, though none knew why.</span><br />
<span class="i1">The neighbors stared and sighed, yet blessed the lad;</span><br />

<p class="main"><i>Minstrel</i> (<i>Lay of the Last</i>). Ladye Margaret, &#8220;the flower of Teviot,&#8221;
was the daughter of Lord Walter Scott, of Branksome Hall. She loved
Baron Henry, of Cranstown; but between the two families a deadly feud
existed. One day the elfin page of Lord Cranstown inveigled the heir of
Branksome Hall (then a lad) into the woods, where he fell into the hands
of the English, who marched with 3000 men to Branksome Hall; but, being
told that Douglas was coming to the rescue with 10,000 men, the two
armies agreed to settle by single combat whether the lad should be given
up to the mother or be made King Edward&#8217;s page. The two champions were
Sir Richard Musgrave (<i>English</i>) and Sir William Deloraine (<i>Scotch</i>).
The Scotch champion slew Sir Richard, and the boy was delivered to his
mother. It now turned out that Sir William Deloraine was Lord Cranstown,
who claimed and received the hand of Ladye Margaret as his reward.&mdash;Sir

<div class="blockquot"><p>This book was finished the ninth year of the reign of King Edward
IV. by Sir Thomas Malory, knight. Thus endeth this noble and joyous
book, entitled <i>La Morte d&#8217;Arthur</i>, notwithstanding it treateth of
the birth, life and acts of the said King Arthur, and of his noble
knights of the Round Table ... and the achieving of the Holy
Sancgreall, and in the end the dolorous death and departing out of
the world of them all.&mdash;Concluding paragraph.</p></div>

<p class="main"><i>Morte d&#8217;Arthur</i>, by Tennyson. The poet follows closely the story of the
death of Arthur, as told by Malory. The king is borne off the field by
Sir Bedivere. Arthur orders the knight to throw his sword Excalibur into
the mere. Twice the knight disobeyed the command, intending to save the
sword; but the dying king detected the fraud, and insisted on being
obeyed. Sir Bedivere then cast the sword into the mere, and an arm,
clothed in white samite, caught it by the hilt, brandished it three
times, and drew it into the mere. Sir Bedivere then carried the dying
king to a barge, in which were three queens, who conveyed him to the
island-valley of Avil&acute;ion, &#8220;where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,
nor ever wind blows loudly.&#8221; Here was he taken to be healed of his
grievous wound; but whether he lived or died we are not told.</p>

<p>In his &#8220;Idylls of the King,&#8221; Tennyson has taken the stories as told by
Malory, and has turned them into his own melodious verse; yet, while
adhering to the substance of each tale, he has in minor matters taken
such liberties as have been allowed to poets since the earliest times.
Shakespeare, in his &#8220;Julius C&aelig;sar,&#8221; makes a like use of Sir Thomas
North&#8217;s translation of Plutarch; the speech of Mark Antony over the body
of C&aelig;sar, to cite the most striking instance among many, is almost a
literal transcription of North&#8217;s version, but subjected to the laws of
verse.</p>

challenge to the ruffian; but, meeting him on the road drunk, he
murdered him, was tried for the crime, but was honorably acquitted. He
wrote a statement of the case, and kept the papers connected with it in
an iron chest. One day Wilford, his secretary, whose curiosity had been
aroused, saw the chest unlocked, and was just about to take out the
documents when Sir Edward entered, and threatened to shoot him; but he
relented, made Wilford swear secrecy, and then told him the whole story.

world as <i>chevaliers de l&#8217;industrie</i>. First, Ape dressed as a
broken-down soldier, and Fox as his servant. A farmer agreed to take
them for his shepherds; but they devoured all his lambs and then
decamped. They next &#8220;went in for holy orders.&#8221; Reynard contrived to get
a living given him, and appointed the ape as his clerk; but they soon
made the parish too hot to hold them, and again sheered off. They next
tried their fortune at court; the ape set himself up as a foreigner of
distinction with Fox for his groom. They played the part of rakes, but
being found to be desperate rogues, had to flee with all despatch, and
seek another field of action. As they journeyed on, they saw a lion
sleeping, and Master Fox persuaded his companion to steal the crown,
sceptre and royal robes. The ape, arrayed in these, assumed to be king,
and Fox was his prime minister; but so ill did they govern, that Jupiter
interfered, the lion was restored, and the ape was docked of his tail
and had his ears cropt.</p>

who was murdered by Rogue Riderhood, and the mistake arose from a
resemblance between the two persons. By his father&#8217;s will, John Harmon

from the apostles. Thus, the apostles laid hands on certain persons, who
(say they) became ministers of the gospel; these persons &#8220;ordained&#8221;
others in the same manner; and the succession has never been broken.
Pennant says, at the Reformation the bishops came to a fix. There was
only one bishop, viz., Anthony Kitchen, of Llandaff, and Bonner would
not allow him to perform the ceremony. In this predicament, the fourteen
candidates for episcopal ordination rummaged up Story, a deposed bishop,
and got him to &#8220;lay hands&#8221; on Parker, as archbishop of Canterbury. As it
would have been profanation for Story to do this in a cathedral or

ends with the death of Siegfried, and the second part with the death of
Kriemhild.</p>

<p>Siegfried, the youngest of the kings of the Netherlands, went to Worms,
to crave the hand of Kriemhild in marriage. While he was staying with
G&uuml;nther, king of Burgundy (the lady&#8217;s brother), he assisted him to
obtain in marriage Brunhild, queen of Issland, who announced publicly
that he only should be her husband who could beat her in hurling a
spear, throwing a huge stone, and in leaping. Siegfried, who possessed a
cloak of invisibility, aided G&uuml;nther in these three contests, and
Brunhild became his wife. In return for these services, G&uuml;nther gave
Siegfried his sister Kriemhild, in marriage. After a time, the bride and
bridegroom went to visit G&uuml;nther, when the two ladies disputed about the
relative merits of their respective husbands, and Kriemhild, to exalt
Siegfried, boasted that G&uuml;nther owed to him his victories and his wife.
Brunhild, in great anger, now employed Hagan to murder Siegfried, and
this he did by stabbing him in the back while he was drinking from a
brook.</p>

<p>Thirteen years elapsed, and the widow married Etzel, king of the Huns.
After a time, she invited Brunhild and Hagan to a visit. Hagan, in this
visit, killed Etzel&#8217;s young son, and Kriemhild was like a fury. A battle
ensued, in which G&uuml;nther and Hagan were made prisoners, and Kriemhild
cut off both their heads with her own hand. Hildebrand, horrified at
this act of blood, slew Kriemhild; and so the poem ends.&mdash;Authors

Bojardo leaves Orlando in love with Angelica, whom he fetched from
Cathay and brought to Paris. Here, says Ariosto, Rinaldo falls in love
with her, and, to prevent mischief, the king placed the coquette under
the charge of Namus; but she contrived to escape her keeper, and fled to
the island of Eb&#363;da, where Rog&#275;ro found her exposed to a sea-monster,
and liberated her. In the mean time, Orlando went in search of his lady,
was decoyed into the enchanted castle of Atlant&ecirc;s, but was liberated by
Angelica, who again succeeded in effecting her escape to Paris. Here she
arrived just after a great battle between the Christians and pagans,
and, finding Med&#333;ra, a Moor, wounded, took care of him, fell in love
with him, and eloped with him to Cathay. When Orlando found himself
jilted, he was driven mad with jealousy and rage, or rather his wits
were taken from him for three months by way of punishment, and deposited
in the moon. Astolpho went to the moon in Elijah&#8217;s chariot, and St. John
gave him &#8220;the lost wits&#8221; in an urn. On reaching France Astolpho bound
the madman, then, holding the urn to his nose, the wits returned to
their nidus, and the hero was himself again. After this, the siege was
continued, and the Christians were wholly successful. (See <a href="#Orlando_Innamorato"><span class="smcap">Orlando

jealousy. A letter, begging that Zara would meet him in a &#8220;secret

<p class="main"><b>Painters&#8217; Characteristics.</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angelo</span> (<i>Michael</i>): an iron frame, strongly developed muscles, and an
anatomical display of the human figure. The &AElig;schylos of painters
(1474-1564).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carracci</span>: eclectic artists, who picked out and pieced together parts
taken from Correggio, Raphael, Titian and other great artists. If
Michael Angelo is the &AElig;schylos of artists, and Raphael the Sophocl&ecirc;s,
the Carracci may be called the Euripid&ecirc;s of painters. I know not why in
England the name is spelt with only one <i>r</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Correggio</span>: known by his wonderful foreshortenings, his magnificent light
and shade. He is, however, very monotonous (1494-1534).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crome</span> (<i>John</i>): an old woman in a red cloak walking up an avenue of
trees (1769-1821).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David</span>: noted for his stiff, dry, pedantic, &#8220;highly classic&#8221; style,
according to the interpretation of the phrase by the French in the first
Revolution (1748-1825).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolce</span> (<i>Cario</i>): famous for his Madonnas, which were all finished with
most extraordinary delicacy (1616-1686).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domenichi&acute;no</span>: famed for his frescoes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> correct in design and fresh in
coloring (1581-1614).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guido</span>: his specialty is a pallid or bluish-complexioned saint, with
saucer or uplifted eyes (1574-1642).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holbein</span>: characterized by bold relief, exquisite finish, force of
conception, delicacy of tone, and dark background (1498-1554).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lorraine</span> (<i>Claude</i>): a Greek temple on a hill, with sunny and highly
finished classic scenery. Aerial perspective (1600-1682).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Murillo</span>: a brown-faced Madonna (1618-1682).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ommeganck</span>: sheep (1775-1826).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perugino</span> (<i>Pietro</i>): known by his narrow, contracted figures and scrimpy
drapery (1446-1524).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poussin</span>: famous for his classic style. Reynolds says: &#8220;No works of any
modern have so much the air of antique painting as those of Poussin&#8221;
(1593-1665).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poussin</span> (<i>Gaspar</i>): a landscape painter, the very opposite of Claude
Lorraine. He seems to have drawn his inspiration from Hervey&#8217;s
<i>Meditations Among the Tombs</i>, Blair&#8217;s <i>Grave</i>, Young&#8217;s <i>Night
Thoughts</i>, and Burton&#8217;s <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> (1613-1675).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphael</span>: the Sophocl&ecirc;s of painters. Angelo&#8217;s figures are all gigantesque
and ideal, like those of &AElig;schylos. Raphael&#8217;s are perfect human beings
(1483-1520).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reynolds</span>: a portrait-painter. He presents his portraits in <i>bal masqu&eacute;</i>,
not always suggestive either of the rank or character of the person
represented. There is about the same analogy between Watteau and
Reynolds as between Claude Lorraine and Gaspar Poussin (1723-1792).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa</span> (<i>Salvator</i>): dark, inscrutable pictures, relieved by dabs of
palette-knife. He is fond of savage scenery, broken rocks, wild caverns,
blasted heaths, and so on (1615-1673).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubens</span>: patches of vermillion dabbed about the human figure, wholly out
of harmony with the rest of the coloring (1577-1640).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steen</span> (<i>Jan</i>): an old woman peeling vegetables, with another old woman
looking at her (1636-1679).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tintoretti</span>: full of wild fantastical inventions. He is called &#8220;The
Lightning of the Pencil&#8221; (1512-1594).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Titian</span>: noted for his broad shades of divers gradations (1477-1576).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Veronese</span> (<i>Paul</i>): noted for his great want of historical correctness
and elegance of design; but he abounds in spirited banquets, sumptuous
edifices, brilliant aerial spectres, magnificent robes, gaud, and
jewelry (1530-1588).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Watteau</span>: noted for his <i>f&ecirc;tes galantes</i>, fancy-ball costumes, and
generally gala-day figures (1684-1721).</p>


<p class="main"><b>Paix des Dames</b> (<i>La</i>), the treaty of peace concluded at Cambray in 1529,
between Fran&ccedil;ois I. of France and Karl V., emperor of Germany. So called
because it was mainly negotiated by Louise of Savoy (mother of the
French king), and Margaret, the emperor&#8217;s aunt.</p>

May. Piers then warns the young man of the vanities of the world, and
tells him of the great degeneracy of pastoral life, at one time simple
and frugal, but now discontented and licentious. He concludes with the
fable of the kid and her dam. The fable is this: A mother-goat, going
abroad for the day, told her kid to keep at home, and not to open the
door to strangers. She had not been gone long when up came a fox, with
head bound from &#8220;headache,&#8221; and foot bound from &#8220;gout,&#8221; and carrying a

light,&#8221; under the charge of St. Bernard (canto xxxi.). The entire region
is divided into ten spheres, each of which is appropriated to its proper

for angels, (2) Mercury, for archangels, (3) Venus, for virtues, (4) the
Sun, for powers, (5) Mars, for principalities, (6) Jupiter, for
dominions, (7) Saturn, for thrones. The eighth sphere is that of the
fixed stars for the cherubim; the ninth is the <i>primum mob&#301;l&ecirc;</i> for the
seraphim; and the tenth is the empyre&acute;an for the Virgin Mary and the
triune deity. Beatrice, with Rachel, Sarah, Judith, Rebecca and Ruth,
St. Augustin, St. Francis, St. Benedict, and others, were enthroned in
Venus, the sphere of the virtues. The empyrean, he says, is a sphere of

redemption. Meantime, Satan enters the orb of the sun, and there learns
the route to the &#8220;new world&#8221; (bk. iii.). On entering Paradise, he
overhears Adam and Eve talking of the one prohibition (bk. iv.). Raphael
is now sent down to warn Adam of his danger, and he tells him who Satan
is (bk. v.); describes the war in heaven, and expulsion of the rebel
angels (bk. vi.). The angel visitant goes on to tell Adam why and how

wisdom. Curiosity induces Eve to taste the same fruit, and she persuades
Adam to taste it also (bk. ix.). Satan now returns to hell, to tell of

conversation with Jesus, advises Him to satisfy His hunger by
miraculously converting stones into bread. Jesus gives the tempter to
know that He recognizes him, and refuses to follow his suggestion.</p>

<p>II. Satan reports progress to his ministers, and asks advice. He returns
to the wilderness, and offers Jesus wealth, as the means of acquiring
power; but the suggestion is again rejected.</p>

<p>III. Satan shows Jesus several of the kingdoms of Asia, and points out
to Him their military power. He advises Him to seek alliance with the
Parthians, and promises his aid. He says by such alliance He might shake
off the Roman yoke, and raise the kingdom of David to first-class power.
Jesus rejects the counsel, and tells the tempter that the Jews were for
the present under a cloud for their sins, but that the time would come
when God would put forth His hand on their behalf.</p>

<p>IV. Satan shows Jesus Rome, with all its greatness, and says, &#8220;I can
easily dethrone Tiberius, and seat Thee on the imperial throne.&#8221; He then
shows Him Athens, and says, &#8220;I will make Thee master of their wisdom and
high state of civilization, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me.&#8221; &#8220;Get
thee behind Me, Satan!&#8221; was the indignant answer; and Satan, finding all

changed by Milcho, to whom he was sold as a slave into &#8220;Cotharig&#8221; (four

cunning. He made a box, and invited the serpent to enter in. The serpent
insisted it was too small; and so high the contention grew that the
serpent got into the box to prove that he was right, whereupon St.
Patrick slammed down the lid, and cast the box into the sea.</p>

<p>This tradition is marvellously like an incident of the <i>Arabian Nights&#8217;
Entertainments</i>. A fisherman had drawn up a box or vase in his net, and
on breaking it open a genius issued therefrom, and threatened the
fisherman with immediate destruction because he had been enclosed so
long. Said the fisherman to the genius, &#8220;I wish to know whether you
really were in that vase.&#8221; &#8220;I certainly was,&#8221; said the genius. &#8220;I cannot
believe it,&#8221; replied the fisherman, &#8220;for the vase could not contain even
one of your feet.&#8221; Then the genius, to prove his assertion, changed into
smoke, and entered into the vase, saying, &#8220;Now, incredulous fisherman,
dost thou believe me?&#8221; But the fisherman clapped the leaden cover on the
vase, and told the genius that he was about to throw the box into the
sea, and that he would build a house on the spot to warn others not to
fish up so wicked a genius.&mdash;<i>Arabian Nights</i> (&#8220;The Fisherman,&#8221; one of

Osirtesen I. (dynasty xii.).</p>

<p>2. The <i>good</i> Pharaoh who advanced Joseph (<i>Gen.</i> xli.). This was,
perhaps, Ap&#333;phis (one of the Hyksos).</p>

<p>3. The Pharaoh who &#8220;knew not Joseph&#8221; (<i>Exod.</i> i. 8). This may be
Amen&acute;ophis I. (dynasty xviii.). The king, at the flight of Moses, I
think, was Thothmes II.</p>

<p>4. The Pharaoh drowned in the Red Sea. As this was at least eighty years
after the persecutions began, probably this was another king. Some say
it was Menephthes, son of Ram&acute;eses II., but it seems quite impossible to
reconcile the account in <i>Exodus</i> with any extant historical account of
Egypt (<i>Exod.</i> xiv. 28). Was it Thothmes III.?</p>

<p>5. The Pharaoh who protected Hadad (1 <i>Kings</i> xi. 19).</p>

<p>6. The Pharaoh whose daughter Solomon married (1 <i>Kings</i> iii. 1; ix.
16). I think this was Psusennes I. (dynasty xxi.).</p>

<p class="main"><i>Pharaohs after Solomon&#8217;s time</i> (mentioned in the Old Testament):</p>

<p>1. Pharaoh Shishak, who warred against Rehoboam (1 <i>Kings</i> xiv. 25, 26;

<p>2. The Pharaoh called &#8220;So&#8221; king of Egypt, with whom Hoshea made an
alliance (2 <i>Kings</i> xvii. 4).</p>

<p>3. The Pharaoh who made a league with Hezekiah against Sennacherib. He
is called Tirh&#257;kah (2 <i>Kings</i>, xviii. 21; xix. 9).</p>

<p>4. Pharaoh Necho, who warred against Josiah (2 <i>Kings</i> xxiii. 29, etc.).</p>

<p class="main"><b>Pharsa&acute;lia</b> (<i>The</i>), a Latin epic in ten books, by Lucan, the subject
being the fall and death of Pompey. It opens with the passage of C&aelig;sar
across the Rub&#301;con. This river formed the boundary of his province, and
his crossing it was virtually a declaration of war (bk. i.). Pompey is
appointed by the senate general of the army to oppose him (bk. v.).
C&aelig;sar retreats to Thessaly; Pompey follows (bk. vi.), and both prepare
for war. Pompey, being routed in the battle of Pharsalia, flees (bk.
vii.), and seeking protection in Egypt, is met by Achillas, the Egyptian
general, who murders him, cuts off his head, and casts his body into the
sea (bk. viii.). Cato leads the residue of Pompey&#8217;s army to Cyr&#275;n&ecirc;, in
Africa (bk. ix.); and C&aelig;sar, in pursuit of Pompey, landing at
Alexandria, is hospitably entertained by Cleopatra (bk. x.). While here,
he tarries in luxurious dalliance, the palace is besieged by Egyptians,
and C&aelig;sar with difficulty escapes to Pharos. He is closely pursued,
hemmed in on all sides, and leaps into the sea. With his imperial robe
held between his teeth, his commentaries in his left hand, and his sword
in his right, he buffets the waves. A thousand javelins are hurled at
him, but touch him not. He swims for empire, he swims for life; &#8217;tis
C&aelig;sar and his fortunes that the waves bear on. He reaches his fleet; is
received by his soldiers with thundering applause. The stars in their
courses fought for C&aelig;sar. The sea-gods were with him, and Egypt with her
host was a by-word and a scorn.</p>

<p><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> Bk. ix. contains the account of the African serpents, by far

<p class="main"><a name="Pied_Piper" id="Pied_Piper"></a><b>Pied Piper of Hamelin</b> (3 <i>syl.</i>), a piper named Bunting, from his dress.
He undertook, for a certain sum of money, to free the town of Hamelin,
in Brunswick, of the rats which infested it; but when he had drowned all
the rats in the river Weser, the townsmen refused to pay the sum agreed
upon. The piper, in revenge, collected together all the children of
Hamelin, and enticed them by his piping into a cavern in the side of the
mountain Koppenberg, which instantly closed upon them, and 130 went down
alive into the pit (June 26, 1284). The street through which Bunting
conducted his victims was Bungen, and from that day to this no music is
ever allowed to be played in this particular street.&mdash;Verstegan,
<i>Restitution of Decayed Intelligence</i> (1634).</p>

<p>Robert Browning has a poem entitled <i>The Pied Piper</i>.</p>

<p>Erichius, in his <i>Exodus Hamelensis</i>, maintains the truth of this

the same dance, and they, too, perished in the lake.</p>

<p>Next year, a charcoal-burner cleared the same place of crickets; and
when the price agreed upon was withheld, he led the sheep of the
inhabitants into the lake.</p>

<p>The third year came a plague of rats, which an old man of the mountain
piped away and destroyed. Being refused his reward, he piped the
children of Lorch into the Tannenberg.</p>

<p><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> About 200 years ago, the people of Ispahan were tormented
with rats, when a little dwarf named Giouf, not above two feet high,
promised, on the payment of a certain sum of money, to free the city of
all its vermin in an hour. The terms were agreed to, and Giouf, by tabor
and pipe, attracted every rat and mouse to follow him to the river
Zenderou, where they were all drowned. Next day, the dwarf demanded the
money; but the people gave him several bad coins, which they refused to
change. Next day, they saw with horror an old black woman, fifty feet
high, standing in the market-place with a whip in her hand. She was the
genie Mergian Banou, the mother of the dwarf. For four days she
strangled daily fifteen of the principal women, and on the fifth day led
forty others to a magic tower, into which she drove them, and they were

<p class="main"><i>Piper</i> (<i>Paddy, the</i>), an Irish piper, supposed to have been eaten by a
cow. Going along one night during the &#8220;troubles,&#8221; he knocked his head
against the body of a dead man dangling from a tree. The sight of the
&#8220;iligant&#8221; boots was too great a temptation: and as they refused to come
off without the legs, Paddy took them too, and sought shelter for the
night in a cowshed. The moon rose, and Paddy, mistaking the moon-light
for the dawn, started for the fair, having drawn on the boots and left
the &#8220;legs&#8221; behind. At daybreak, some of the piper&#8217;s friends went in
search of him, and found, to their horror, that the cow, as they
supposed, had devoured him with the exception of his legs&mdash;clothes,
bags, and all. They were horror-struck, and of course the cow was
condemned to be sold; but while driving her to the fair, they were
attracted by the strains of a piper coming towards them. The cow
startled, made a bolt, with a view, as it was supposed, of making a meal
on another piper. &#8220;Help, help!&#8221; they shouted; when Paddy himself ran to
their aid. The mystery was soon explained over a drop of the &#8220;cratur,&#8221;
and the cow was taken home again.&mdash;S. Lover, <i>Legends and Stories of

sons is repeated in that of Cosmo de Medici, of Florence, and his two

whether we regard the characters or the incidents of the two families.</p>

<p>Pisistratos was a great favorite of the Athenian populace; so was Cosmo
de Medici with the populace of Florence. Pisistratos was banished, but,
being recalled by the people, was raised to sovereign power in the
republic of Athens; so Cosmo was banished, but, being recalled by the
people, was raised to supreme power in the republic of Florence.
Pisistratos was just and merciful, a great patron of literature, and
spent large sums of money in beautifying Athens with architecture; the
same may be said of Cosmo de Medici. To Pisistratos we owe the poems of
Homer in a connected form; and to Cosmo we owe the best literature of
Europe, for he spent fortunes in the copying of valuable MSS. The two
sons of Pisistratos were Hipparchos and Hippias; and the two grandsons
of Cosmo were Guiliano and Lorenzo. Two of the most honored citizens of
Athens (Harmodios and Aristog&#299;ton) conspired against the sons of
Pisistratos&mdash;Hipparchos was assassinated, but Hippias escaped; so
Francesco Pazzi and the archbishop of Pisa conspired against the
grandsons of Cosmo&mdash;Guiliano was assassinated, but Lorenzo escaped. In
both cases it was the elder brother who fell, and the younger who
escaped. Hippias quelled the tumult, and succeeded in placing himself at
the head of Athens; so did Lorenzo in Florence.</p>

out daily for its meal. The Antioch&acute;eans cast lots for the first victim,
and the lot fell on Marana, who was led forth in grand procession as the
victim of the dragon. Pithyrian, in distraction, rushed into a Christian
church, and fell before an image which attracted his attention, at the
base of which was the real arm of a saint. The sacristan handed the holy
relic to Pithyrian, who kissed it, and then restored it to the
sacristan; but the servitor did not observe that a thumb was missing.
Off ran Pithyrian with the thumb, and joined his daughter. On came the
dragon, with tail erect, wings extended, and mouth wide open, when
Pithyrian threw into the gaping jaws the &#8220;sacred thumb.&#8221; Down fell the

objects; the beauty of mind and the moral faculties. Bk. ii.

imagination and memory of past griefs and dangers. The poem concludes
with the supposition that in the life to come this faculty will be
greatly enlarged. The episode is this: Florio, a young sportsman,
accidentally met Julia in a grot, and followed her home, when her
father, a rich squire, welcomed him as his guest, and talked with
delight of his younger days, when hawk and hound were his joy of joys.
Florio took Julia for a sail on the lake, but the vessel was capsized,

claim a pound of flesh from Antonio&#8217;s body. The loan was not repaid, and

express permission of the king. It also gave French subjects the right
of appealing, in certain cases, from the ecclesiastical to the civil
courts of the realm.</p>

France, in 1438. By this ordinance the power of the people in France was
limited and defined. The authority of the National Council was declared
superior to that of the pope. The French clergy were forbidden to appeal
to Rome on any point affecting the secular condition of the nation; and
the Roman pontiff was wholly forbidden to appropriate to himself any
vacant living, or to appoint to any bishopric or parish church in
France.</p>

and a European war was the result.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Pragmatic Sanction of Charles III. of Spain</i> (1767). This was to
suppress the Jesuits of Spain.</p>

<p>What is meant emphatically by <i>The Pragmatic Sanction</i> is the third of
these ordinances, viz., settling the line of suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>cession in Germany on

to whole lines of kings, it will explain the enormous diversity of time
allotted by different writers to &#8220;Prester John.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bishop Jord&#257;nus, in his description of the world, sets down Abyssinia as
the kingdom of Prester John. Abyssinia used to be called &#8220;Middle India.&#8221;</p>

<p>Otto of Freisingen is the first author to mention him. This Otto wrote a
chronicle to the date 1156. He says that John was of the family of the
Magi, and ruled over the country of these Wise Men. Otto tells us that
Prester John had &#8220;a sceptre of emeralds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maimon&#301;d&ecirc;s, about the same time (twelfth century), mentions him, but
calls him &#8220;Prester-Cuan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before 1241 a letter was addressed by &#8220;Prester John&#8221; to Manuel Comn&#275;nus,
emperor of Constantinople. It is preserved in the <i>Chronicle</i> of
Albericus Trium Fontium, who gives for its date 1165.</p>

<p>Mandeville calls Prester John a lineal descendant of Ogier, the Dane. He
tells us that Ogier, with fifteen others, penetrated into the north of
India, and divided the land amongst his followers. John was made
sovereign of Teneduc, and was called &#8220;Prester&#8221; because he converted the
natives to the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Another tradition says that Prester John had seventy kings for his
vassals, and was seen by his subjects only three times in a year.</p>

<p>In <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, Prester John is called by his subjects &#8220;Sen&#257;pus,
king of Ethiopia.&#8221; He was blind, and though the richest monarch of the
world, he pined with famine, because harpies flew off with his food by
way of punishment for wanting to add paradise to his empire. The plague,
says the poet, was to cease &#8220;when a stranger appeared on a flying
griffin.&#8221; This stranger was Astolpho, who drove the harpies to Cocy&acute;tus.
Prester John, in return for this service, sent 100,000 Nubians to the
aid of Charlemagne. Astolpho supplied this contingent with horses by
throwing stones into the air, and made transport-ships to convey them to
France by casting leaves into the sea. After the death of Agramant, the
Nubians were sent home, and then the horses became stones again, and the
ships became leaves (bks. xvii.-xix.).</p>

Standish, a bluff old soldier, in the middle of life, wished to marry

<p class="main"><b>Prison Life Endeared.</b> The following are examples of prisoners who, from
long habit, have grown attached to prison life:&mdash;</p>

<p>Comte de Lorge was confined for thirty years in the Bastile, and when
liberated (July 14, 1789) declared that freedom had no joys for him.
After imploring in vain to be allowed to return to his dungeon, he
lingered for six weeks and pined to death.</p>

<p>Goldsmith says, when Chinvang the Chaste, ascended the throne of China,
he commanded the prisons to be thrown open. Among the prisoners was a
venerable man of 85 years of age, who implored that he might be suffered
to return to his cell. For sixty-three years he had lived in its gloom
and solitude, which he preferred to the glare of the sun and the bustle
of a city.&mdash;<i>A Citizen of the World</i> lxxiii. (1759).</p>

<p>Mr. Cogan once visited a prisoner of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> state in the King&#8217;s Bench prison,
who told him he had grown to like the subdued light and extreme solitude
of his cell; he even liked the spots and patches on the wall, the
hardness of his bed, the regularity, and the freedom from all the cares
and worries of active life. He did not wish to be released, and felt
sure he should never be so happy in any other place.</p>

<p>A woman of Leyden, on the expiration of a long imprisonment, applied for
permission to return to her cell, and added, if the request was refused
as a favor, she would commit some offence which should give her a title
to her old quarters.</p>

<p>A prisoner condemned to death had his sentence commuted to seven years&#8217;
close confinement on a bed of nails. After the expiration of five years,
he declared, if ever he were released, he should adopt from choice what
habit had rendered so agreeable to him.</p>


<p class="main"><b>Prisoner of Chillon</b>, Fran&ccedil;oise de Bonnivard, a Frenchman, who resided at

incarcerated him for six years in a dungeon of the Ch&acirc;teau de Chillon,
at the east end of the lake of Geneva. The prisoner was ultimately
released by the Bernese, who were at war with Savoy.</p>

<p>Byron has founded on this incident his poem entitled <i>The Prisoner of
Chillon</i>, but has added two brothers, whom he supposes to be imprisoned
with Fran&ccedil;oise, and who die of hunger, suffering, and confinement. In
fact, the poet mixes up Dant&ecirc;&#8217;s tale about Count Ugolino with that of

and all the conspirators except Jaffier were condemned to death by
torture. Jaffier stabbed Pierre, to save him from the wheel, and then
killed himself. Belvidera went mad and died. Priuli lived on, a

before, save by our first parents.&#8221; The stars were symbolical of the
four cardinal virtues (prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance).
Turning round, he observed old Cato, who said that a dame from Heaven
had sent him to prepare the Tuscan poet for passing through Purgatory.
Accordingly, with a slender reed, old Cato girded him, and from his face
he washed &#8220;all sordid stain,&#8221; restoring to his face &#8220;that hue which the
dun shades of Hell had covered and concealed&#8221; (canto i.). Dant&ecirc; then
followed his guide, Virgil, to a huge mountain in mid-ocean antipodal to
Judea, and began the ascent. A party of spirits were ferried over at the
same time by an angel, amongst whom was Casella, a musician, one of
Dant&ecirc;&#8217;s friends. The mountain, he tells us, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> divided into terraces,

rivers&mdash;Leth&ecirc; and Eu&acute;noe (3 <i>syl.</i>). The first eight cantos are occupied
by the ascent, and then they come to the gate of Purgatory. This gate is
approached by three stairs (faith, penitence and piety); the first stair
is transparent white marble, as clear as crystal; the second is black
and cracked; and the third is of blood-red porphyry (canto ix.). The
porter marked on Dant&ecirc;&#8217;s forehead seven P&#8217;s (<i>peccata</i>, &#8220;sins&#8221;), and
told him he would lose one at every stage, till he reached the river
which divided Purgatory from Paradise. Virgil continued his guide till
they came to Leth&ecirc;, when he left him during sleep (canto xxx.). Dant&ecirc;
was then dragged through the river Leth&ecirc;, drank of the waters of Eun&#335;e,

imagination perverted by romance, and crazed with ideas of chivalry. He
is the hero of a Spanish romance by Cervantes. Don Quixote feels himself
called on to become a knight-errant to defend the oppressed, and succor
the injured. He engages for his squire Sancho Panza, a middle-aged,
ignorant rustic, selfish, but full of good sense, a gourmand, attached
to his master, shrewd and credulous. The knight goes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> forth on his
adventures, thinks <i>wind-mills</i> to be giants, <i>flocks of sheep</i> to be
armies, <i>inns</i> to be castles, and <i>galley-slaves</i> oppressed gentlemen;

restored to his right mind, and dies like a peaceful Christian. The
object of this romance was to laugh down the romances of chivalry of the
Middle Ages.</p>

born, was slain by Sir Gareth; the Green Knight, which represents the
young day-spring, was overcome, but not slain; and the Red Knight, being
overcome, was spared also. The reason is this: darkness is <i>slain</i>, but
dawn is only <i>overcome</i> by the stronger light of noon, and noon decays
into the evening twilight. Tennyson in his <i>Gareth and Lynette</i>, calls

scandalous conduct of his son Sextus, who had violated Lucretia, the
wife of Collatinus. Thirty combined cities of Latium, with Sabines and
Volscians, took the part of Tarquin, and marched towards Rome. The
Romans met the allied army at the Lake Regillus, and here, on July 15,
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 499, they won the great battle which confirmed their republican
constitution, and in which Tarquin, with his sons Sextus and Titus, was
slain. While victory was still doubtful, Castor and Pollux, on their
white horses, appeared to the Roman dictator, and fought for the Romans.
The victory was complete, and ever after the Romans observed the
anniversary of this battle with a grand procession and sacrifice. The
procession started from the temple of Mars outside the city walls,
entered by the Porta Cap&#275;na, traversed the chief streets of Rome,
marched past the temple of Vesta in the Forum, and then to the opposite
side of the &#8220;great square,&#8221; where they had built a temple to Castor and

town on the Adriatic, near Ancona, whither it was miraculously
transported through the air by angels in the year 1294. It had been

resting there for three years was again lifted up and placed where
it now stands. It is a small brick structure surrounded by a marble
screen designed by Bramante and decorated with carvings and
sculptures by a number of celebrated sculptors. The church in which
the house stands was built over it to protect it shortly after its
arrival.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Holy Coat.</span> This is the seamless coat worn by Jesus, and for
which the soldiers drew lots at his crucifixion. It is described by
John alone of the evangelists: &#8220;Now the coat was without seam,
woven from the top throughout.&#8221; John 19, 23. It is preserved at
Treves in the cathedral, and is shown at long intervals to the

Europe and America. It was last shown in 1891. The village of
Argenteuil, near Paris, disputes with Treves the possession of the
true garment, insisting on its own superior claim, but the right of
Treves is generally acknowledged by Catholics.</p>

way to Calvary, one of the women standing by, whose name was
Veronica, seeing Him sinking under the weight of the cross, gave
Him her handkerchief to wipe the sweat from His face. When He
returned it the impression of His face was left upon the cloth, and
remains distinctly to be seen at the present day.</p>

off; but Sir Richard stood his ground. He had only a hundred men, but
with this crew and his one ship, he encountered the Spanish fleet. The
fight was very obstinate. Some of the Spanish ships were sunk, and many
shattered; but Sir Richard at length was wounded, and the surgeon shot
while dressing the wound. &#8220;Sink the ship, master gunner!&#8221; cried Sir
Richard; &#8220;sink the ship, and let her not fall into the hands of Spain!&#8221;
But the crew were obliged to yield, and Sir Richard died. The Spaniards
were amazed at Grenville&#8217;s pluck, and gave him all honors, as they cast
his body into the sea. <i>The Revenge</i> was then manned by Spaniards, but

Lord Howe took six of the French ships, June 1, 1794; but <i>La Vengeur</i>
was sunk by the crew, that it might not fall into the hands of the
English, and went down while the crew shouted &#8220;Vive la R&eacute;publique!&#8221; The

on a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of Italian history in 1698. The case was this:
Guido Franceschini, a Florentine count of shattered fortune, married
Pompilia, thinking her to be an heiress. When the young bride discovered
that she had been married for her money only, she told her husband she
was no heiress at all, but was only the supposititious child of Pietro
(2 <i>syl.</i>), supplied by one Violant&ecirc;, for the sake of keeping in his
hands certain entailed property. The count now treated Pompilia so
brutally that she ran away from home, under the protection of
Caponsacchi, a young priest, and being arrested at Rome, a legal
separation took place. Pompilia sued for a divorce, but, pending the
suit, gave birth to a son. The count now murdered Pietro, Violant&ecirc;, and
Pompilia, but being taken red-handed, was brought to trial, found
guilty, and executed.</p>

of Arden, and lodged for a time in a hut; but they had not been long

murder, he was seen by many haunting the locality, and was supposed to
be a ghost. He joined the Gordon rioters when they attacked and burnt to
the ground the house of Mr. Haredale, the son of the murdered man, and
being arrested (ch. lvi.), was sent to Newgate, but made his escape with
the other prisoners when it was burnt down by the rioters. Being

It was thought for many years that Rudge had been murdered in defending
his master, and Mrs. Rudge was allowed a pension by Mr. Haredale, son
and heir of the murdered man. This pension she subsequently refused to
take. After the reprieve of Barnaby, Mrs. Rudge lived with him in a

compiled the <i>Elder</i> or <i>Rythmical Edda</i>, often called <i>S&aelig;mund&#8217;s Edda</i>.
This compilation contains not only mythological tales and moral
sentences, but numerous sagas in verse or heroic lays, as those of
V&ouml;lung and Helg&ecirc;, of Sigurd and Brynhilda, of Folsungs and Niflungs (pt.
ii.). Probably his compilation contained all the mythological, heroic,
and legendary lays extant at the period in which he lived (1054-1133).</p>


<p class="main"><b>Saga</b>, the goddess of history.&mdash;<i>Scandinavian Mythology.</i></p>


<p class="main"><b>Saga and Edda.</b> The <i>Edda</i> is the Bible of the ancient Scandinavians. A
saga is a book of instruction, generally, but not always, in the form of
a tale, like a Welsh &#8220;mabinogi.&#8221; In the <i>Edda</i> there are numerous sagas.
As our Bible contains the history of the Jews, religious songs, moral
proverbs, and religious stories, so the <i>Edda</i> contained the history of
Norway, religious songs, a book of proverbs, and numerous stories. The
original <i>Edda</i> was compiled and edited by S&aelig;mund Sigfusson, an
Icelandic priest and scald, in the eleventh century. It contains
twenty-eight parts or books, all of which are in verse.</p>

<p>Two hundred years later, Snorro Sturleson, of Iceland, abridged,
re-arranged, and reduced to prose the <i>Edda</i>, giving the various parts a
kind of dramatic form,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> like the dialogues of Plato. It then became
needful to distinguish these two works; so the old poetical compilation
is the <i>Elder</i> or <i>Rythmical Edda</i>, and sometimes the <i>S&aelig;mund Edda</i>,
while the more modern work is called the <i>Younger</i> or <i>Prose Edda</i>, and
sometimes the <i>Snorro Edda</i>. The <i>Younger Edda</i> is, however, partly
original. Pt. i. is the old <i>Edda</i> reduced to prose, but pt. ii. is
Sturleson&#8217;s own collection. This part contains &#8220;The Discourse of Bragi&#8221;
(the scald of the gods) on the origin of poetry; and here, too, we find
the famous story called by the Germans the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>.</p>


<p class="main"><b>Sagas.</b> Besides the sagas contained in the <i>Eddas</i>, there are numerous
others. Indeed, the whole saga literature extends over 200 volumes.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Edda Sagas.</span> The <i>Edda</i> is divided into two parts and twenty-eight
lays or poetical sagas. The first part relates to the gods and heroes of
Scandinavia, creation, and the early history of Norway. The Scandinavian
&#8220;Books of Genesis&#8221; are the &#8220;Voluspa Saga,&#8221; or &#8220;prophecy of Vola&#8221; (about
230 verses), &#8220;Vafthrudner&#8217;s Saga,&#8221; and &#8220;Grimner&#8217;s Saga.&#8221; These three
resemble the Sibylline books of ancient Rome, and give a description of
chaos, the formation of the world, the creation of all animals
(including dwarfs, giants and fairies), the general conflagration, and
the renewal of the world, when, like the new Jerusalem, it will appear
all glorious, and there shall in no wise enter therein &#8220;anything that
defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Book of Proverbs&#8221; in the <i>Edda</i> is called the &#8220;H&acirc;vam&acirc;l Saga,&#8221; and
sometimes &#8220;The High Song of Odin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;V&ouml;lsunga Saga&#8221; is a collection of lays about the early Teutonic
heroes.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Saga of St. Olaf&#8221; is the history of this Norwegian king. He was a
savage tyrant, hated by his subjects, but because he aided the priests
in forcing Christianity on his subjects, he was canonized.</p>

<p>The other sagas in the <i>Edda</i> are &#8220;The Song of Lodbrok&#8221; or &#8220;Lodbrog,&#8221;
&#8220;Hervara Saga,&#8221; the &#8220;Vilkina Saga,&#8221; the &#8220;Blomsturvalla Saga,&#8221; the

and the &#8220;Eryrbiggia Saga&#8221; (which pertain to Iceland). All the above were
compiled and edited by S&aelig;mund Sigfusson, and are in verse; but Snorro
Sturleson reduced them to prose in his prose version of the old <i>Edda</i>.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Sagas not in the Edda.</span> Snorro Sturleson, at the close of the twelfth
century, made the second great collection of chronicles in verse, called
the <i>Heimskringla Saga</i>, or the book of the kings of Norway, from the
remotest period to the year 1177. This is a most valuable record of the
laws, customs, and manners of the ancient Scandinavians. Samuel Laing
published his English translation of it in 1844.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Icelandic Sagas.</i> Besides the two Icelandic sagas collected by
S&aelig;mund Sigfusson, numerous others were subsequently embodied in the
<i>Landama Bok</i>, set on foot by Ari hinn Frond&ecirc;, and continued by various
hands.</p>

<p>2. <i>Frithjof&#8217;s Saga</i> contains the life <a name="corr144" id="corr144"></a><ins class="correction" title="and">and and</ins> adventures of Frithjof,
of Iceland, who fell in love with Ingeborg, the beautiful wife of Hring,
king of Norway. On the death of Hring, the young widow marries her
Icelandic lover. Frithjof lived in the eighth century, and this saga was
compiled at the beginning of the fourteenth century, a year or two after
the <i>Heimskringla</i>. It is very interesting, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span> Tegn&eacute;r, the Swedish
poet, has selected it for his <i>Idylls</i> (1825), just as Tennyson has
taken his idyllic stories from the <i>Morte d&#8217;Arthur</i> or the Welsh
<i>Mabinogion</i>. Tegn&eacute;r&#8217;s <i>Idylls</i> were translated into English by Latham
(1838), by Stephens (1841), and by Blackley (1857).</p>

<p>3. <i>The Swedish Saga</i>, or lay of Swedish &#8220;history,&#8221; is the <i>Ingvars
Saga</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Russian Saga</i>, or lay of Russian legendary history, is the
<i>Egmunds Saga</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Folks-Sagas</i> are stories of romance. From this ancient
collection we have derived our nursery tales of <i>Jack and the
Bean-Stalk</i>, <i>Jack the Giant-Killer</i>, the <i>Giant who smelt the Blood of
an Englishman</i>, <i>Blue Beard</i>, <i>Cinderella</i>, the <i>Little Old Woman cut
Shorter</i>, the <i>Pig that wouldn&#8217;t go over the Bridge</i>, <i>Puss in Boots</i>,
and even the first sketches of <i>Whittington and His Cat</i>, and <i>Baron
Munchausen</i>. (See Dasent, <i>Tales from the Norse</i>, 1859.)</p>

<p>6. <i>Sagas of Foreign origin.</i> Besides the rich stores of original tales,
several foreign ones have been imported and translated into Norse, such
as <i>Barlaham and Josaphat</i>, by Rudolph of Ems, one of the German
minnesingers. On the other hand, the minnesingers borrowed from the
Norse sagas their famous story embodied in the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>, called
the &#8220;German <i>Iliad</i>,&#8221; which is from the second part of Snorro
Sturleson&#8217;s <i>Edda</i>.</p>


<p class="main"><b>Sagaman</b>, a narrator of sagas. These ancient chroniclers differed from
scalds in several respects. Scalds were minstrels, who celebrated in
verse the exploits of living kings or national heroes; sagamen were
tellers of legendary stories, either in prose or verse, like
Scheheraz&#257;d&ecirc;, the narrator of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, the mandarin,
Fum-Hoam, the teller of the <i>Chinese Tales</i>, Moradbak, the teller of the
<i>Oriental Tales</i>, Fer&#259;morz, who told the tales to Lalla Rookh, and so
on. Again, scalds resided at court, were attached to the royal suite,
and followed the king in all his expeditions; but sagamen were free and
unattached, and told their tales to prince or peasant, in lordly hall or
at village wake.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In Mr. Emerson we have a poet and a profoundly religious man, who
is really and entirely undaunted by the discoveries of science,
past, present or prospective. In his case, poetry, with the joy of
a Bacchanal, takes her graver brother, science, by the hand, and
cheers him with immortal laughter. By Emerson scientific
conceptions are continually transmuted into the finer forms and
warmer lines of an ideal world.&mdash;Professor Tyndall, <i>Fragments of

Valirian was accordingly &#8220;cristened&#8221; by St. Urban, returned home, and
found the angel with two crowns, brought direct from paradise. One he
gave to Cecile and one to Valirian, saying that &#8220;bothe with the palme of
martirdom schullen come unto God&#8217;s blisful feste.&#8221; Valirian suffered
martydom first; then Almachius, the Roman prefect, commanded his

the bath all day and night, yet, &#8220;sat she cold, and felte of it no woe.&#8221;
Then smote they her three strokes upon the neck, but could not smite her
head off. She lingered on for three whole days, preaching and teaching,
and then died. St. Urban buried her body privately by night, and the
house he converted into a church, which he called the church of

<p class="main"><b>St. Christopher</b>, a native of Lycia, very tall, and fearful to look at.
He was so proud of his strength that he resolved to serve only the
mightiest, and went in search of a worthy master. He first entered the
service of the emperor; but one day, seeing his master cross himself for
fear of the devil, he quitted his service for that of Satan. This new
master he found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> was thrown into alarm at the sight of a cross; so he
quitted him also, and went in search of the Saviour. One day, near a
ferry, a little child accosted him, and begged the giant to carry him
across the water. Christopher put the child on his back, but found every
step he took the child grew heavier and heavier, till the burden was
more than he could bear. As he sank beneath his load, the child told the
giant he was Christ, and Christopher resolved to serve Christ and Him
alone. He died three days afterwards, and was canonized. The Greek and
Latin churches look on him as the protecting saint against floods, fire,
and earthquake.&mdash;James de Voragine, <i>Golden Legends</i>, 100 (thirteenth
century).</p>

<p><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> His body is said to be at Valencia, in Spain; one of his arms

Rome; and a tooth and rib at Venice. His day is May 9 in the Greek
Church, and July 25 in the Latin. Of course, &#8220;the Christ-bearer&#8221; is an
allegory. The gigantic bones called his relics may serve for &#8220;matters of
faith&#8221; to give reality to the fable.</p>

<p>(His name before conversion was Off&#277;rus, but after he carried Christ

a picture of this nineteenth-century saint, representing her as hovering

virgin martyr herself told a priest and a nun in a dream, that she was
Fi[lia] Lumina, the daughter Lumina, <i>i.e.</i> the daughter of the Light of
the world. In confirmation of this dream, as her bones were carried to
Mugnano, the saint repaired her own skeleton, made her hair grow, and
performed so many miracles, that those must indeed be hard of belief who

family it remained for a century. The sieur deposited it with Henri IV.
as a security for a loan of money. The servant entrusted with it, being

which Christ ate at the Last Supper, brought to England by Joseph of
Arimathy. Whatever it was, it appeared to King Arthur and his 150
knights of the Round Table, but suddenly vanished, and all the knights
vowed they would go in quest thereof. Only three, Sir Bors, Sir
Percivale and Sir Galahad, found it, and only Sir Galahad had touched
it, but he soon died, and was borne by angels up into heaven. The
Sangraal of Arthurian romance is &#8220;the dish&#8221; containing Christ
transubstantiated by the sacrament of the Mass, and made visible to the
bodily eye of man. This will appear quite obvious to the reader by the
following extracts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Then anon they heard cracking and crying of thunder.... In the
midst of the blast entered a sunbeam more clear by seven times than
the day, and all they were alighted of the grace of the Holy
Ghost.... Then there entered into the hall the Holy Grale covered
with white samite, but there was none that could see it, nor who
bare it, but the whole hall was full filled with good odors, and
every knight had such meat and drink as he best loved in the world,
and when the Holy Grale had been borne through the hall, then the
holy vessel departed suddenly, and they wist not where it
became.&mdash;Ch. 35.</p>

<p>Then looked they and saw a man come out of the holy vessel, that
had all the signs of the passion of Christ, and he said ... &#8220;This
is the holy dish wherein I ate the lamb on Sher-Thursday, and now
hast thou seen it ... yet hast thou not seen it so openly as thou
shalt see it in the city of Sarras ... therefore thou must go hence
and bear with thee this holy vessel, for this night it shall depart
from the realm of Logris ... and take with thee ... Sir Percivale
and Sir Bors.&#8221;&mdash;Ch. 101.</p>

<p>So departed Sir Galahad, and Sir Percivale and Sir Bors with him.
And so they rode three days, and came to a river, and found a ship
... and when on board, they found in the midst the table of silver
and the Sancgreall covered with red samite.... Then Sir Galahad
laid him down and slept ... and when he woke ... he saw the city of
Sarras (ch. 103).... At the year&#8217;s end ... he saw before him the
holy vessel, and a man kneeling upon his knees in the likeness of
the bishop, which had about him a great fellowship of angels, as it
had been Christ Himself ... and when he came to the sakering of the
Mass, and had done, anon he called Sir Galahad, and said unto him,
&#8220;Come forth ... and thou shalt see that which thou hast much
desired to see&#8221; ... and he beheld spiritual things ... (ch.
104).&mdash;Sir T. Malory, <i>History of Prince Arthur</i>, iii. 35, 101, 104

no blood at all; yet no food that man eats turns so soon into life-blood
as the scallop.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Display of Heraldy</i>, 171.</p>

<p class="main"><i>Scallop-shells used by Pilgrims.</i> The reason why the scallop-shell is
used by pilgrims is not generally known. The legend is this: When the
marble ship which bore the headless body of St. James approached Bouzas,
in Portugal, it happened to be the wedding day of the chief magnate of
the village; and while the bridal party was at sport, the horse of the
bridegroom became unmanageable, and plunged into the sea. The ship
passed over the horse and its rider, and pursued its onward course,
when, to the amazement of all, the horse and its rider emerged from the
water uninjured, and the cloak of the rider was thickly covered with
scallop-shells. All were dumbfounded, and knew not what to make of these
marvels, but a voice from heaven exclaimed, &#8220;It is the will of God that
all who henceforth make their vows to St. James, and go on pilgrimage,
shall take with them scallop-shells; and all who do so shall be
remembered in the day of judgment.&#8221; On hearing this, the lord of the
village, with the bride and bridegroom, were duly baptized, and Bouzas
became a Christian Church.&mdash;<i>Sanctoral Portugues</i> (copied into the
<i>Breviaries</i> of <i>Alcoba&ccedil;a and St. Cucufate</i>).</p>

another made the same remark, and the Brahmin, beginning to doubt, took
down the goat to look at it. Convinced that the creature was really a
goat, he went on, when presently a third made the same remark. The
Brahmin, now fully persuaded that his eyes were befooling him, threw
down the goat and went away without it; whereupon the three companions
took possession of it and cooked it.</p>

<p>In <i>Tyll Eulenspiegel</i> we have a similar hoax. Eulenspiegel sees a man
with a piece of green cloth, which he resolves to obtain. He employs two
confederates, both priests. Says Eulenspiegel to the man, &#8220;What a famous
piece of blue cloth! Where did you get it?&#8221; &#8220;Blue, you fool! why, it is
green.&#8221; After a short contention, a bet is made, and the question in
dispute is referred to the first comer. This was a confederate, and he
at once decided that the cloth was blue. &#8220;You are both in the same
boat,&#8221; says the man, &#8220;which I will prove by the priest yonder.&#8221; The
question being put to the priest, is decided against the man, and the
three rogues divide the cloth amongst them.</p>

&#8220;Winter&#8221; (1726), &#8220;Summer&#8221; (1727), &#8220;Spring&#8221; (1728), &#8220;Autumn&#8221; (1730).
&#8220;Winter&#8221; is inscribed to the earl of Wilmington; &#8220;Summer&#8221; to Mr.
Doddington; &#8220;Spring&#8221; to the countess of Hertford; and &#8220;Autumn&#8221; to Mr.
Onslow.</p>

<p>1. In &#8220;Winter,&#8221; after describing the season, the poet introduces his
episode of a traveller lost in a snowstorm, &#8220;the creeping cold lays him
along the snow, a stiffened <a name="corr164" id="corr164"></a><ins class="correction" title="corpse,&#8221;">corse,&#8221;</ins> of wife, of children, and of
friends unseen. The whole book containing 1069 lines.</p>

<p>2. &#8220;Summer&#8221; begins with a description of the season, and the rural
pursuits of haymaking and sheep-shearing; passes on to the hot noon,
when &#8220;nature pants, and every stream looks languid.&#8221; After describing
the tumultuous character of the season in the torrid zone, he returns to
England, and describes a thunder-storm, in which Cel&#259;don and Amelia are
overtaken. The thunder growls, the lightnings flash, louder and louder
crashes the aggravated roar, &#8220;convulsing heaven and earth.&#8221; The maiden,
terrified, clings to her lover for protection. &#8220;Fear not, sweet
innocence,&#8221; he says. &#8220;He who involves yon skies in darkness ever smiles
on thee. &#8217;Tis safety to be near thee, sure, and thus to clasp
protection.&#8221; As he speaks the words, a flash of lightning strikes the
maid, and lays her a blackened corpse at the young man&#8217;s feet. The poem
concludes with the more peaceful scenery of a summer&#8217;s evening, when the
story of Damon and Musid&#333;ra is introduced. Damon had long loved the
beautiful Musidora, but met with scant encouragement. One summer&#8217;s
evening he <a name="corr165" id="corr165"></a><ins class="correction" title="accidentally">accidently</ins> came upon her bathing, and the respectful
modesty of his love so won upon the damsel that she wrote upon a tree,
&#8220;Damon, the time may come when you need not fly.&#8221; The whole book
contains 1804 lines.</p>

<p>3. In &#8220;Spring&#8221; the poet describes its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span> general features, and its
influence on the vegetable and animal world. He describes a garden with
its harem of flowers, a grove with its orchestry of song-birds making
melody in their love, the rough world of brutes, furious and fierce with
their strong desire, and lastly man tempered by its infusive influence.
The book contains 1173 lines.</p>

<p>4. In &#8220;Autumn&#8221; we are taken to the harvest-field, where the poet
introduces a story similar to that of Ruth and Boaz. His Ruth he calls
&#8220;Lavinia,&#8221; and his Boaz &#8220;Pal&#275;mon.&#8221; He then describes partridge and
pheasant shooting, hare and fox hunting, all of which he condemns. After
luxuriating in the orchard and vineyard, he speaks of the emigration of
birds, the falling of the sear and yellow leaf, and concludes with a
eulogy of country life. The whole book contains 1371 lines.</p>

<p><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> It is much to be regretted that the poet&#8217;s order has not been
preserved. The arrangement of the seasons into Spring, Summer, Autumn,
and Winter, is unnatural, and mars the harmony of the poet&#8217;s plan.</p>

Sedillo was a gouty old gourmand of 69. Being ill, he sent for Dr.
Sangrado, who took from him six porringers of blood every day, and dosed
him incessantly with warm water, giving him two or three pints at a

error to suppose that blood is needful for the preservation of life.
Warm water,&#8221; he maintained, &#8220;drunk in abundance, is the true specific in
all distempers.&#8221; When the licentiate died under this treatment, the

<p class="main"><b>Sentimental Journey</b> (<i>The</i>), by Laurence Sterne (1768). It was intended
to be sentimental sketches of his tour through Italy in 1764, but he
died soon after completing the first part. The tourist lands at Calais,
and the first incident is his interview with a poor monk of St. Francis,
who begged alms for his convent. Sterne refused to give anything, but
his heart smote him for his churlishness to the meek old man. From
Calais he goes to Montriul (Montreuil-sur-Mer) and thence to Nampont,
near Cressy. Here occurred the incident, which is one of the most
touching of all the sentimental sketches, that of &#8220;The Dead Ass.&#8221; His
next stage was Amiens, and thence to Paris. While looking at the
Bastille, he heard a voice crying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t get out! I can&#8217;t get out!&#8221;
He thought it was a child, but it was only a caged starling. This led
him to reflect on the delights of liberty and miseries of captivity.
Giving reins to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span> fancy, he imaged to himself a prisoner who for
thirty years had been confined in a dungeon, during all which time &#8220;he
had seen no sun, no moon, nor had the voice of kinsman breathed through
his lattice.&#8221; Carried away by his feelings, he burst into tears, for he
&#8220;could not sustain the picture of confinement which his fancy had
drawn.&#8221; While at Paris, our tourist visited Versailles, and introduces
an incident which he had witnessed some years previously at Rennes, in
Brittany. It was that of a marquis reclaiming his sword and &#8220;patent of
nobility.&#8221; Any nobleman in France who engaged in trade, forfeited his
rank; but there was a law in Brittany that a nobleman of reduced
circumstances might deposit his sword temporarily with the local
magistracy, and if better times dawned upon him, he might reclaim it.
Sterne was present at one of these interesting ceremonies. A marquis had
laid down his sword to mend his fortune by trade, and after a successful
career at Martinico for twenty years, returned home, and reclaimed it.
On receiving his deposit from the president, he drew it slowly from the
scabbard, and, observing a spot of rust near the point, dropped a tear
on it. As he wiped the blade lovingly, he remarked, &#8220;I shall find some
other way to get it off.&#8221; Returning to Paris, our tourist starts for
Italy; but the book ends with his arrival at Moulines (Moulins). Some
half a league from this city he encountered Maria, whose pathetic story
had been told him by Mr. Shandy. She had lost her goat when Sterne saw
her, but had instead a little dog named Silvio, led by a string. She was
sitting under a poplar, playing on a pipe her vespers to the Virgin.
Poor Maria had been crossed in love, or, to speak more strictly, the
cur&eacute; of Moulines had forbidden her banns, and the maiden lost her
reason. Her story is exquisitely told, and Sterne says, &#8220;Could the
traces be ever worn out of her brain, and those of Eliza out of mine,
she should not only eat of my bread and drink of my cup, but Maria
should lie in my bosom, and be unto me as a daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p class="main"><b>Seven Sleepers</b> (<i>The</i>). The tale of these sleepers is told in divers
manners. The best accounts are those in the <i>Kor&acirc;n</i> xviii., entitled,
&#8220;The Cave, Revealed at Mecca;&#8221; <i>The Golden Legends</i>, by Jacques de
Voragine; the <i>De Gloria Martyrum</i>, i. 9, by Gregory of Tours; and the
<i>Oriental Tales</i>, by Comte de Caylus (1743).</p>

<p class="main"><i>Names of the Seven Sleepers.</i> Gregory of Tours says their names were:
Constantine, Dionysius, John, Maximian, Malchus, Martinian or Marcian,
and Serap&#301;on. In the <i>Oriental Tales</i> the names given are: Jemlikha,
Mekchilinia, Mechlima, Merlima, Debermouch, Charnouch, and the shepherd
Keschetiouch. Their names are not given in the <i>Kor&acirc;n</i>.</p>

<p class="main"><i>Number of the Sleepers.</i> Al Seyid, a Jacobite Christian of Najr&acirc;n, says
the sleepers were only three, with their dog; others maintain that their
number was five, besides the dog; but Al Beid&acirc;wi, who is followed by
most authorities, says they were seven, besides the dog.</p>

<p class="main"><i>Duration of the Sleep.</i> The <i>Kor&acirc;n</i> says it was &#8220;300 years and nine
years over;&#8221; the <i>Oriental Tales</i> say the same; but if Gregory of Tours
is followed, the duration of the sleep was barely 230 years.</p>

<p class="main"><i>The Legend of the Seven Sleepers.</i> (1) According to Gregory of Tours.
Gregory says they were seven noble youths of Ephesus, who fled in the
Decian persecution to a cave in Mount Celion, the mouth of which was
blocked up by stones. After 230 years they were discovered, and awoke,
but died within a few days, and were taken in a large stone coffin to
Marseilles. Visitors are still shown, in St. Victor&#8217;s Church, the stone
coffin.</p>

<p>If there is any truth at all in the legend, it amounts to this: In <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
250, some youths (three or seven) suffered martyrdom under the Emperor
Decius, &#8220;fell asleep in the Lord,&#8221; and were buried in a cave of Mount
Celion. In 479 (the reign of Theodosius) their bodies were discovered,
and, being consecrated as holy relics, were removed to Marseilles.</p>

<p>(2) According to the <i>Oriental Tales</i>. Six Grecian youths were slaves in
the palace of Daki&#257;nos (<i>Decianus</i>, <i>Decius</i>). This Dakianos had risen
from low degrees to kingly honors, and gave himself out to be a god.
Jemlikha was led to doubt the divinity of his master, because he was
unable to keep off a fly which persistently tormented him, and being
roused to reflection, came to the conclusion that there must be a god to
whom both Dakianos and the fly were subject. He communicated his
thoughts to his companions, and they all fled from the Ephesian court
till they met the shepherd Keschetiouch, whom they converted, and who
showed them a cave, which no one but himself knew of. Here they fell
asleep, and Dakianos, having discovered them, commanded the mouth of the
cave to be closed up. Here the sleepers remained 309 years, at the
expiration of which time they all awoke, but died a few hours
afterwards.</p>

<p class="main"><i>The Dog of the Seven Sleepers.</i> In the notes of the <i>Kor&acirc;n</i>, by Sale,
the dog&#8217;s name is Kratim, Kratimer, or Katmir. In the <i>Oriental Tales</i>
it is Catnier, which looks like a clerical blunder for Catmer, only it
occurs frequently. It is one of the ten animals admitted into Mahomet&#8217;s
paradise. The <i>Kor&acirc;n</i> tells us that the dog followed the seven young men
into the cave, but they tried to drive him away, and even broke three of
its legs with stones, when the dog said to them, &#8220;I love those who love
God. Sleep, masters, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span> I will keep guard.&#8221; In the <i>Oriental Tales</i>
the dog is made to say, &#8220;You go to seek God, but am not I also a child
of God?&#8221; Hearing this, the young men were so astounded, they went
immediately, and carried the dog into the cave.</p>

<p class="main"><i>The Place of Sepulture of the Seven Sleepers.</i> Gregory of Tours tells
us that the bodies were removed from Mount Celion in a stone coffin to
Marseilles. The <i>Kor&acirc;n</i>, with Sale&#8217;s notes, informs us they were buried
in the cave, and a chapel was built there to mark the site. (See
<span class="smcap">Sleeper</span>.)</p>

<p class="main"><i>The Seven Sleepers turning on their sides.</i> William of Malmesbury says
that Edward the Confessor, in his mind&#8217;s eye, saw the seven sleepers
turn from their right sides to their left, and (he adds) whenever they
turn on their sides, it indicates great disasters to Christendom.</p>

repelled her advances, and she accused him to the king of taking

could tide over seven days his life would be spared; so seven wise

guest of Lucretia when he defiled her. (2) The elopement of Helen was
the cause of a national war between the Greek cities and the allied
cities of Troy; and the defilement of Lucretia was the cause of a
national war between Rome and the allied cities under Por&acute;sena. (3) The
contest between Greece and Troy terminated in the victory of Greece, the
injured party; and the contest between Rome and the supporters of
Tarquin terminated in favor of Rome, the injured party. (4) In the
Trojan war, Paris, the aggressor, showed himself before the Trojan
ranks, and defied the bravest of the Greeks to single combat, but when
Menelaos appeared, he took to flight; and so Sextus rode vauntingly
against the Roman host, but when Herminius appeared, fled to the rear
like a coward. (5) In the Trojan contest, Priam and his sons fell in

runs thus: C&eacute;lie was betrothed to L&eacute;lie, but her father, Gorg&#301;bus,
insisted on her marrying Val&egrave;re, because he was the richer man. C&eacute;lie
fainted on hearing this, and dropped her lover&#8217;s miniature, which was
picked up by Sganarelle&#8217;s wife. Sganarelle, thinking it to be the
portrait of a gallant, took possession of it, and L&eacute;lie asked him how he
came by it. Sganarelle said he took it from his wife, and L&eacute;lie supposed
that C&eacute;lie had become the wife of Sganarelle. A series of
misapprehensions arose thence: C&eacute;lie supposed that L&eacute;lie had deserted
her for Madame Sganarelle; Sganarelle supposed that his wife was
unfaithful to him; madame supposed that her husband was an adorer of
C&eacute;lie; and L&eacute;lie supposed that C&eacute;lie was the wife of Sganarelle. In time
they met together, when L&eacute;lie charged C&eacute;lie with being married to
Sganarelle; both stared, an explanation followed, when a messenger
arrived to say that Val&egrave;re was married.&mdash;Moli&egrave;re, <i>Le Cocu Imaginaire</i>.</p>

<p class="main"><i>Sganarelle</i>, younger brother of Ariste (2 <i>syl.</i>); a surly,
domineering, conceited fellow, the dupe of the play. His brother says to
him, &#8220;Cette farouche humeur &agrave; tous vos proc&eacute;d&eacute;s inspire un air bizarre,
et, jusques &agrave; l&#8217;habit, rend tout chez vous barbare.&#8221; The father of
Isabelle and L&eacute;onor, on his death-bed, committed them to the charge of
Sganarelle and Ariste, who were either to marry them or dispose of them
in marriage. Sganarelle chose Isabelle, but insisted on her dressing in
serge, going to bed early, keeping at home, looking after the house,
mending the linen, knitting socks, and never flirting with any one. The
consequence was, she duped her guardian, and cajoled him into giving his
signature to her marriage with Val&egrave;re.&mdash;Moli&egrave;re, <i>L&#8217;Ecole des Maris</i>.</p>

<p class="main"><i>Sganarelle</i> (3 <i>syl.</i>). At about 63 years of age, Sganarelle wished to
marry Dorim&egrave;ne (3 <i>syl.</i>), daughter of Alcantor, a girl fond of dances,
parties of pleasure, and all the active enjoyments of young life.
Feeling some doubts about the wisdom of this step, he first consults a
friend, who dissuades him, but, seeing the advice is rejected, replies
&#8220;Do as you like.&#8221; He next consults two philosophers, but they are so
absorbed in their philosophy, that they pay no attention to him. He then
asks the gypsies, who take his money and decamp with a dance. At length,
he overhears Dorim&egrave;ne telling a young lover that she only marries the
old dotard for his money, and that he cannot live above a few months; so
he makes up his mind to decline the marriage. The father of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span> lady
places the matter in his son&#8217;s hands, and the young fire-eater, armed
with two swords, goes at once to the old <i>fianc&eacute;</i>, and begs him to
choose one. When Sganarelle declines to fight, the young man beats him
soundly, and again bids him choose a sword. After two or three good
beatings, Sganarelle consents to the marriage &#8220;forc&eacute;.&#8221;&mdash;Moli&egrave;re, <i>Le

<p><sup class="astsup">*</sup><sub class="astsub">*</sub><sup class="astsup">*</sup> This joke about marrying is borrowed from Rabelais,
<i>Pantagruel</i>, iii. 35, etc. Panurge asks Trouillogan whether he would
advise him to marry. The sage says &#8220;No.&#8221; &#8220;But I wish to do so,&#8221; says the
prince. &#8220;Then do so, by all means,&#8221; says the sage. &#8220;Which, then, would
you advise?&#8221; asks Panurge. &#8220;Neither,&#8221; says Trouillogan. &#8220;But,&#8221; says
Panurge, &#8220;that is not possible.&#8221; &#8220;Then both,&#8221; says the sage. After this,
Panurge consults many others on the subject, and lastly the oracle of
the Holy Bottle.</p>

<p>The plot of Moli&egrave;re&#8217;s comedy is founded on an adventure recorded of the
count of Grammont (<i>q.v.</i>). The count had promised marriage to la belle
Hamilton, but deserted her, and tried to get to France. Being overtaken
by the two brothers of the lady, they clapped their hands on their
swords, and demanded if the count had not forgotten something or left
something behind. &#8220;True,&#8221; said the count; &#8220;I have forgotten to marry
your sister;&#8221; and returned with the two brothers to repair this
oversight.</p>

<p class="main"><i>Sganarelle</i>, father of Lucinde. Anxious about his daughter because she
has lost her vivacity and appetite, he sends for four physicians, who
retire to consult upon the case, but talk only on indifferent topics.
When Sganarelle asks the result of their deliberation, they all differ,
both in regard to the disease, and the remedy to be applied. Lisette
(the lady&#8217;s maid) sends for Clitandre, the lover, who comes disguised as
a quack doctor, tells Sganarelle that the young lady&#8217;s disease must be
acted on through the imagination, and prescribes a mock marriage.
Sganarelle consents to the experiment, but Clitandre&#8217;s assistant being a
notary, the mock marriage proves to be a real one.&mdash;Moli&egrave;re, <i>L&#8217;Amour

the house of a noted doctor. She sends them to her husband, and tells
them he is so eccentric that he will deny being a doctor, but they must
beat him well. So they find the faggot-maker, whom they beat soundly,
till he consents to follow them. He is introduced to Lucinde, who
pretends to be dumb, but, being a shrewd man, he soon finds out that the
dumbness is only a pretence, and takes with him L&eacute;andre as an
apothecary. The two lovers understand each other, and Lucinde is rapidly
cured with &#8220;pills matrimoniac.&#8221;&mdash;Moli&egrave;re, <i>Le M&eacute;decin Malgr&eacute; Lui</i>

governor. The general of the Syrians was Pho&acute;cyas, and of the Arabs,
Caled. Phocyas asked Eumen&ecirc;s&#8217;s permission to marry his daughter,
Eudo&acute;cia, but was sternly refused. After gaining several victories he
fell into the hands of the Arabs, and then joined them in their siege in
order to revenge himself on Eumen&ecirc;s. Eudocia fell into his power, but
she refused to marry a traitor. Caled requested Phocyas to point out to
him the governor&#8217;s tent; on being refused, they fought, and Caled fell.
Abudah, being now in chief command, made an honorable peace with the
Syrians, Phocyas died, and Eudocia retired to a convent.&mdash;J. Hughes,

<p class="main"><b>Sieg&acute;fried</b> [<i>Seeg.freed</i>], hero of pt. i. of the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>, the
old German epic. Siegfried was a young warrior of peerless strength and
beauty, invulnerable except in one spot between his shoulders. He
vanquished the Nibelungs, and carried away their immense hoards of gold
and precious stones. He wooed and won Kriemhild, the sister of G&uuml;nther,
king of Burgundy, but was treacherously killed by Hagan while stooping
for a draught of water after a hunting expedition.</p>

<p>Siegfried had a cape, or cloak, which rendered him invisible, the gift
of the dwarf, Alberich; and his sword, called Balmung, was forged by
Wieland, blacksmith of the Teutonic gods.</p>

<p>This epic consists of a number of different lays by the old
minnesingers, pieced together into a connected story as early as 1210.

it remained vulnerable.&mdash;The minnesingers, <i>The Nibelungen Lied</i> (1210).</p>

the day of renunciation, El&#277;&#275;mon, her father&#8217;s freed slave, who loved
her, sold himself to the devil, on condition of obtaining her for his
wife. He signed the bond with a drop of his heart&#8217;s blood, and carried
about with him a little red spot on his <a name="corr181" id="corr181"></a><ins class="correction" title="breast,">bresst,</ins> as a perpetual
reminder of the compact. The devil now sent a dream to Cyra, and another
to her father, which caused them to change their plans; and on the very
day that Cyra was to have taken the veil, she was given by St. Basil in
marriage to Eleemon, with whom she lived happily for many years, and had
a large family. One night, while her husband was asleep, Cyra saw the
blood-red spot; she knew what it meant, and next day Eleemon told her
the whole story. Cyra now bestirred herself to annul the compact, and
went with her husband to St. Basil, to whom a free and full confession
was made. Eleemon was shut up for a night in a cell, and Satan would
have carried him off, but he clung to the foot of a crucifix. Next day
Satan met St. Basil in the cathedral, and demanded his bond. St. Basil
assured him the bond was illegal and invalid. The devil was foiled, the
red mark vanished from the skin of Eleemon, a sinner was saved, and St.
Basil came off victorious.&mdash;Amphilochius, <i>Life of St. Basil</i>. (See

<p class="main"><b>Sisyphus</b>, in the Milesian tales, was doomed to die, but when Death came
to him, the wily fellow contrived to fasten the unwelcome messenger in a
chair, and then feasted him till old Spare-ribs grew as fat as a prize
pig. In time, Pluto released Death, and Sisyphus was caught, but prayed
that he might speak to his wife before he went to Had&ecirc;s. The prayer was
granted, and Sisyphus told his wife not to bury him, for though she
might think him dead, he would not be really so. When he got to the
infernal regions, he made the ghosts so merry with his jokes, that Pluto
reproved him, and Sisyphus pleaded that, as he had not been buried,
Pluto had no jurisdiction over him, nor could he even be ferried across
the Styx. He then obtained leave to return to earth, that he might
persuade his wife to bury him. Now, the wily old king had previously
bribed Herm&ecirc;s, when he took him to Had&ecirc;s, to induce Zeus to grant him
life, provided he returned to earth again in the body; when, therefore,
he did return, he demanded of Herm&ecirc;s the fulfillment of his promise, and
Herm&ecirc;s induced Zeus to bestow on him life. Sisyphus was now allowed to
return to earth, with a promise that he should never die again, till he
him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>self implored for death. So he lived, and lived till he was weary of
living, and when he went to Had&ecirc;s the second time, he was allotted, by
way of punishment, the task of rolling a huge stone to the top of a
mountain. Orpheus (2 <i>syl.</i>), asked him how he could endure so ceaseless
and vain an employment, and Sisyphus replied that he hoped ultimately to
accomplish the task. &#8220;Never,&#8221; exclaimed Orpheus; &#8220;it can never be done!&#8221;

hope.&#8221;&mdash;Lord Lytton, <i>Tales of Miletus</i>, ii.</p>
